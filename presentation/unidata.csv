","This unit introduces computational linguistics and the statistical techniques and algorithms used to automatically process natural languages (such as English or Chinese). It will review the core statistics and information theory, and the basic linguistics, required to understand statistical natural language processing (NLP). Statistical NLP is used in a wide range of applications, including information retrieval and extraction; question answering; machine translation; and classifying and clustering of documents. This unit will explore the key challenges of natural language to computational modelling, and the state of the art approaches to the key NLP sub-tasks, including tokenisation, morphological analysis, word sense representation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and other information extraction, text categorisation, phrase structure parsing and dependency parsing. You will implement many of these sub-tasks in labs and assignments. The unit will also investigate the annotation process that is central to creating training data for statistical NLP systems. You will annotate data as part of completing a real-world NLP task.

","This unit covers topics of active and cutting-edge research within IT in the area of 'Cloud Computing'.  
Cloud Computing is an emerging paradigm of utilising large-scale computing services over the Internet that will affect individual and organization's computing needs from small to large. Over the last decade, many cloud computing platforms have been set up by companies like Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, Ebay and Facebook. Some of the platforms are open to public via various pricing models. They operate at different levels and enable business to harness different computing power from the cloud.  
In this course, we will describe the important enabling technologies of cloud computing, explore the state-of-the art platforms and the existing services, and examine the challenges and opportunities of adopting cloud computing. The unit will be organized as a series of presentations and discussions of seminal and timely research papers and articles. Students are expected to read all papers, to lead discussions on some of the papers and to complete a hands-on cloud-programming project.","This unit covers topics of active and cutting-edge research within IT in the area of 'Cloud Computing'.

","The world is increasingly filled with systems, devices and sensors collecting large amounts of data on a continual basis.

Taking this spatial context into account transforms analyses, problem-solving and provides a powerful method of visualising the world. This is the essence of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and this unit. This unit starts by introducing students to the 'building blocks' of GIS systems, including data structures, relational databases, spatial queries and analysis. The focus then moves on to sources of spatial data including Global Positioning System (GPS), operational systems such as smartcard ticketing and transaction data along with web-based sources highlighting both the potential and challenges associated with integrating each data source within a GIS environment. The unit is hands-on involving learning how to use the latest GIS software to analyse several problems of interest using real 'big data' sources and to communicate the results in a powerful and effective way. These include identifying potential demand for new services or infrastructure, creating a delivery and scheduling plan for a delivery firm or examining the behaviour of travellers or consumers over time and locations.

What is less recognised is the nature of the roles of those who access and make decisions about collected linked personal information. The emerging global banked data that has become a key part of contemporary decision-making raises questions about the role of the data scientist. In this course students will critically analyse the ethical and legal foundations of data science governance that are relevant to the technical processes of data collection, storage, exchange and access. Issues covered will include the ethical dimensions of data management, legal and regulatory frameworks in Australia and in relevant jurisdictions, data policy, data privacy, data ownership, legal liabilities regarding analytical decisions, and discrimination. The course will equip students to identify the ethical and legislative requirements that underpin the technical processes of data science and to apply ethical and legal considerations to the core processes of data analytics. It will also introduce algorithms and technical approaches to minimise the risk of data identifiability and disclosure. A range of case studies will be used to explore these issues in applications of data science, including the use of government administrative data for informing social policy, to integrate ethical, legal and technical considerations.","Gathering, understanding, interpreting and making decisions based on collected data is an invaluable tool for science, business and governments.

If you want to share a piece of information or a site on social media, you would like to grab precious attention from other equally eager users of social media; if you are curious to know what is hidden or who is influential in the complex world of social media, you might wonder how one can find this information in big and messy social media; if you hope to serve your customers better in social media, you certainly want to employ effective means to understand them better. These are just some scenarios in which this course can help. Master the knowledge of fundamental elements and basic concepts in social media analytics| Use important metrics and models to characterize and measure networks| Acquire both principles and hands-on practical experience of implementing algorithms and models for various applications based on social media data, such as identifying influential users, computing the importance of each user in social networks, community discovery, influence propagation and maximization, epidemic, link prediction| Explain, analyse and discuss the discovered actionable patterns from social media data| Evaluate the performance of social media analyzing algorithms"

This has led to the development and widespread use of many new statistical tools including the bootstrap, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and non-parametric kernel smoothing methods. Computer intensive statistical methods are not only in general use by statisticians, but are also applied by quantitative researchers in the life sciences, medicine and biological science, social sciences and business.This unit gives a broad coverage of computer intensive methods with numerous applied examples, together with the underlying general concepts and basic theory. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of these methods in real statistical applications. Data sets are analysed using the statistical package R.

It explains where in the economy government intervention is needed and why; how this intervention influences the behaviour of actors in the private sector; and the welfare effects of such intervention. The course also applies a political economy lens to understand how and why behaviour in the public sector is determined not only by economic concerns but also by political processes. Specific topics to be covered include welfare economics, optimal taxation, market failure, economic regulation, market design, innovation policy, industrial policy, and political economy. The usefulness of these concepts for understanding and implementing effective economic stewardship will be demonstrated through their application to selected industrial sectors in Australia, such as the electricity and gas sector, mining, water, telecommunications, and transport infrastructure.","This course investigates the role of the public sector in the economic arena.
