## Background Story & Motivations {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

- Data science has been a buzzword since it came out

- Is there a standard definition of data science in Australia?

- Does data science mean the same thing to universities and employers?

## Agenda of the day {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

:::{.incremental}

- Data science degree in Australian universities (Go8)

  - Data collection

  - Text analysis

- How employers define a 'data scientist'

- Key findings, limitations and future directions

## Data Science Degrees at Universities {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}


- What are the teaching contents? (e.g. statistics, math, IT etc.)

- What could be the common skill sets of a data science graduate?

- Is there a 'standard structure' for data science degree across the Go8?


## Data Collection {.scrollable background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

- Web scrapping course information, list of subjects and unit outlines from universities' websites

- Performed using RSelenium and rvest

- Used robots.text files as guidelines


## Data Collection - Web Scraping {.scrollable background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

Initial settings and navigation to the course handbook

```{.r code-line-numbers="1-2|4-5|7-9|11-20|22-23"}
library(RSelenium)
library(rvest)

rD <- rsDriver(browser="firefox", port=4778L, verbose=F)
remDr <- rD[["client"]]

baseurl <- "https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au"
year <- 2022
wait_time <- function() Sys.sleep(sample(3:5, 1))

data <- tibble(Course = character(),
               Course_code = character(),
               Course_overview = character(),
               Unit = character(),
               Unit_code = character(),
               Overview = character(),
               Prerequisite = character(),
               Corequisite = character(),
               Prohibition = character(),
               Outcomes = character())

remDr$navigate("https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/courses/mc-datasc")
course_html <- read_html(remDr$getPageSource()[[1]])
```


## Data Collection - Web Scraping {.scrollable background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

Extract required information

```{.r code-inline-numbers=""}


```


## Be Mindful of Ethics Issues! {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

- Getting blocked...

- Waiting time, pages that are prohibited for web scrapping

- Robots.text


## Text Analysis - Bigram {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

:::: {.columns}

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)


```

::: {.column width="40%"}
overview
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
university breakdown - proportion
:::

::::


- count is too small to make meaningful interpretations

## Break Down by Faculty {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

Computational, Statistical or Mathematical? 

- Conducted based on the first few characters from unit code

- Using only the unit code could be misleading

## Further Analysis with the Concepts of Text Corpus {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}



- wordtovec, but due to time we'll only talk about lda

- word count after applying three models

- contructing tcm, document term matrix

- convering text data into something numerical

## Still a Work in Porgress... {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

- It takes experienced linguists and huge efforts to build a text corpus

- The models are still relatively basic and requires more trimming and training


## Employer Perspectives {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

-

-


## Limitations and Future Directions {background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

- Inconsistency of the data

- No information on programming languages taught at universities

- Not all universities have data science degree

- The LDA models fitted are not optimised

## To Sum Up! {.scrollable background-image="images/bg.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

:::{incremental}

- What we have done:

  - Collected data across Go8 through web scrapping

  - Conducted exploratory analysis from various aspects on both university and employer data
  
  - Built LDA models through web scrapping Wikipedia articles to establish our own 'text corpus'


- Key findings: 

  - There is no obvious 'standard structure' for data science degree across Go8 (different unit codes etc.)
  
  - The degree is dominated by computational component, even the statistical aspects of it are more computational
  
  - employers want more python, how monash differs compare with other universities.

- post questions to the audience, how data science should evolve, where should it head
