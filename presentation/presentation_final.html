Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP. It discusses logical and physical design of data warehouses including star schema, snowflake schema, data marts, partitioning and materialised views. Students study the use of data warehouses through a study of the OLAP technology including the multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP) architectures, OLAP operations and structured query language (SQL) support for OLAP.","There is an explosion in data generation and data collection due to improvements in sensing technologies and business processes.

Both finite dimensional problems which involve a vector of variables, including linear and nonlinear programming, and infinite dimensional problems where the variables are functions, including optimal control problems, are covered.","Optimization is the mathematical problem of finding a decision to achieve the best possible outcome while satisfying certain restrictions. Linear programs, conic linear programs and discrete optimization problems arise in a myriad of applications: electricity markets, airlines, logistics, public transport, international shipping, mining, finance, engineering, and data science.&lt;U+00A0&gt;This course will provide an introduction to the basic mathematical theory, modelling techniques, computational methods and selected applications of linear, conic and discrete optimization.","Various aspects of graph theory, including: matchings, coverings and packings, connectivity, graph colourings, planar graphs, extremal graphs and Ramsey theory, the probabilistic method, random graphs.Note: Course not offered every year - contact School for more information.","Regression is a set of statistical techniques widely used to analyse relationships between several variables.The topics covered in this course include: linear regression; weighted least squares; generalised linear models; tting GLMs and diagnostics; Poisson, binomial regression; analysis of variance; penalised regression methods; splines; penalised splines; thin plate splines; variable selection; generalised cross-validation; local likelihood; kernel smoothing; generalised additive models; multinomial logit analysis; ordinal logistic regression.The lectures will be complemented with worked examples using the R data analysis and statistical programming software.","Increasingly, organisations need to analyse enormous data sets to determine useful structure in them. In response to this, a range of statistical methods and tools have been developed in recent times to allow accurate and quick analysis of these sets.Topics include: choosing the right data mining tool for your data, linear methods (logistic regression and generalized linear models) and data mining, clustering methods, decision trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, wavelet smoothing, hybrid models, neural networks, support vector machines, bagging and boosting methods. Case studies of industry-based data mining projects feature prominently. The most recent data mining software is used to illustrate the methods.&lt;U+00A0&gt;","The course is concerned with the theory and application of appropriate statistical techniques for analysis of time series data -- data collected over time. The course will develop a sound understanding of the time domain properties and common models for stationary and non-stationary time series in discrete time. The topics include the theory of stationary time series; methods for trend and seasonal analysis and adjustment; modelling and forecasting with autoregressive moving avarage processes; modelling the impact of exogenous or intervention variables on responses; models for stochastic volatility and long term dependence; regression models for time series counts. Applications are primarily drawn from finance and public health. SAS is used to perform appropriate analyses.","This course is an elective course for the Master and/or Honours degree of Statistics program. It gives another insight into statistical theory by addressing the problems from a nonparametric point-of-view, that is, by making no or few assumptions on the distribution from which the data were drawn (unlike most of the classical statistical procedures which are essentially parametric). As such, it can be thought of as an interesting complement to most of the other courses offered in the program.","In this course a methodological background for categorical data analysis is given. Theoretical foundations of the commonly used techniques in analysing data where the response outcomes are categories, are discussed. The accompanying exploratory variables may also be categorical or be continuous. Within the generalised linear model framework, topics such as logistic regression, Poisson regression, logit and log-linear models and analysis of categorised time-to event data are discussed. Computing features prominently in this course.","After describing the fundamentals of Bayesian inference, this course will examine the specification of prior and posterior distributions, Bayesian decision theoretic concepts, the ideas behind Bayesian hypothesis tests, model choice and model averaging, and evaluate the capabilities of several common model types, such as hierarchical and mixture models. An important part of Bayesian inference is the requirement to numerically evaluate complex integrals on a routine basis. Accordingly this course will also introduce the ideas behind Monte Carlo integration, importance sampling, rejection sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers such as the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and use of the WinBuGS posterior simulation software. Pre-requisites: 24 units of level III mathematics or a degree in a numerate discipline or permission of the Head of Department.","This course exposes students to the possibilities for welfare gains available through the thoughtful application of insights from behavioural economics to adjust incentives in a variety of real-world settings.&lt;U+00A0&gt; The study of applications will be preceded and motivated through a consideration of the gaps in mainstream economic theory and the developing ways that behavioural economics attempts to fill these gaps.&lt;U+00A0&gt; Through a combination of exploring frontier behavioural economics theory and working through case studies of the application of behavioural economics to a series of real-world policy interventions in Australia and abroad, students will gain an understanding of the power of theoretically-grounded behavioural economics insights to enhance traditional economic understanding and improve the stewardship of modern economies.","This course investigates the role of the public sector in the economic arena. It explains where in the economy government intervention is needed and why; how this intervention influences the behaviour of actors in the private sector; and the welfare effects of such intervention. The course also applies a political economy lens to understand how and why behaviour in the public sector is determined not only by economic concerns but also by political processes. Specific topics to be covered include welfare economics, optimal taxation, market failure, economic regulation, market design, innovation policy, industrial policy, and political economy. The usefulness of these concepts for understanding and implementing effective economic stewardship will be demonstrated through their application to selected industrial sectors in Australia, such as the electricity and gas sector, mining, water, telecommunications, and transport infrastructure.","A first course on database management systems. Data modelling;   principles of database design; data manipulation languages; database  application techniques; introduction to DBMS internals; introduction to  advanced databases. Lab: design and implementation of a database  application using SQL and stored procedures.","This course will introduce statistical and visualisation&lt;U+00A0&gt;tools for the exploratory analysis of data.&lt;U+00A0&gt;Students will learn what makes an effective data visualisation and how to create interactive data visualisations.&lt;U+00A0&gt;Visualisation in&lt;U+00A0&gt;R, Tableau and other tools&lt;U+00A0&gt;including cutting-edge graphical, immersive techniques will be used.There will be a strong focus on developing the skill&lt;U+00A0&gt;of data storytelling: where students will learn to combine data,&lt;U+00A0&gt;its visualisation and a narrative to create a powerful story to drive change.","This course exposes students to research methods in applying data science and decisions techniques to a research project. The project courses serve as a capstone in the Master of Data Science and Decisions program. Students will be required to apply and demonstrate their learning from the courses in the program. It also requires students to present their work in visual and verbal forms including a presentation.","This course exposes students to research methods in applying data science and decisions techniques to a research project.

The course provides students with the tools to use economic principles in decision-making and an understanding of the broader economic environment in which business decisions must be made.","This course covers the fundamentals of Game Theory and its applications. Game Theory is a revolutionary way of analysing strategic interactive situations. It is basic to the understanding of market competition among large firms, the designing of incentive contracts, bidding at auctions, bargaining, and other similar problems central to economics and business. This course covers simultaneous and sequential games and their solution concepts, games of imperfect information, repeated games, and a selection of applications and case studies.","The course gives a methodological background in Multivariate Analysis as a backbone of Applied Statistics. It introduces multivariate techniques including principal component analysis; canonical correlation analysis; cluster analysis; factor analysis and discriminant analysis. Computing and data analysis features prominently in this course.Pre-requisites: 24 units of level III mathematics or a degree in a numerate discipline or permission of the Head of Department.Note: Course not offered every year. Contact School for more information.","This course presents General interference theory based on maximum likelihood and on Bayes methods is reviewed. Estimation, confidence set construction and hypothesis testing are discussed within decision-theoretic framework. Computationally intensive methods such as bootstrap are discussed and are compared to asymptotic approximations such as saddlepoint and empirical likelihood.Pre-requisites: 24 units of level III mathematics or a degree in a numerate discipline or permission of the Head of Department.Note: Course not offered every year - contact the School for more information."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>School<\/th>\n      <th>Course<\/th>\n      <th>Unit<\/th>\n      <th>Outcomes<\/th>\n      <th>Overview<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"rowCallback":"function(row, data, displayNum, displayIndex, dataIndex) {\n}"}},"evals":["options.rowCallback"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
