Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP. It discusses logical and physical design of data warehouses including star schema, snowflake schema, data marts, partitioning and materialised views.

It combines concepts from 'image processing' (in the spatial and frequency domains) and 'pattern recognition'. Computer vision has a wide number of potential applications, including satellite imaging, control and measurement, industrial inspection, surveillance (e.g. face recognition) and medical applications. This unit covers topics such as binary image analysis, greyscale image manipulation, linear and nonlinear filtering, feature extraction, image enhancement, image segmentation and recognition. It also covers camera calibration and projective geometry and how three-dimensional information can be reconstructed from single images, stereo pairs of images and motion sequences. In the future, it is anticipated that computer vision systems will become prevailing, and that vision technology will be more applied across a broad range of business and consumer products. This will result in a strong industry demand for computer vision engineers�for people who understand vision technology and know how to apply it in real-world problems.","Enrolment in       in the   (      HON-CMSSE Computer Science and Software Engineering [Honours]   or      the 62530 Master of Data Science   or      the 63550 Master of Engineering   )         or         (      the 62550 Master of Professional Engineering   and      the SP-EBIOM Biomedical Engineering specialisation   or      the SP-EELEC Electrical and Electronic Engineering specialisation   or      the SP-ESOFT Software Engineering specialisation   )         or         (      the 53560 Master of Physics   and      the SPSP-MEDPH Medical Physics specialisation   )         or         (      the BH008 Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science [Honours]   and      the MJD-ARIDM Artificial Intelligence major   )         or         (      the BH011 Bachelor of Engineering [Honours]   and      the MJD-EAUTO Automation and Robotics Engineering major   )","Nil","CITS2401 Computer Analysis and Visualisation And MATH1012 Mathematical Theory and Methods (Note: Students must have the ability to program in a high-level programming language and the ability to reason in linear algebra and calculus.)","Students are able to (1) explain computer vision problems in writing; (2) write MATLAB code to solve computer vision problems; (3) describe the theories and principles in computer vision; (4) conduct independent research on a chosen research topic, write a small research report, and give an oral presentation; (5) demonstrate logical thinking and problem-solving skills; (6) process images in both the spatial and frequency domains; (7) explain the technical theory behind formation of images; and (8) critique various methodologies for solving problems in computer vision and image processing.","Elective","CITS4402"

Once upon a time, intuitively attractive statistical procedures had to be consigned to the waste bin if they led to unfathomable mathematical complications, or required masses of intricate calculations for their practical implementation. Now such difficulties can often be circumvented by using computer simulation and number crunching. This has led to the development and widespread use of many new statistical tools including the bootstrap, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and non-parametric kernel smoothing methods. Computer intensive statistical methods are not only in general use by statisticians, but are also applied by quantitative researchers in the life sciences, medicine and biological science, social sciences and business.This unit gives a broad coverage of computer intensive methods with numerous applied examples, together with the underlying general concepts and basic theory. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of these methods in real statistical applications. Data sets are analysed using the statistical package R.
