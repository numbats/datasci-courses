So much so that some have predicted the replacement of human by superior artificial intelligence in many domains with catastrophic results. Other argue that interface with DLANNs is already changing the nature of human cognition by enabling the harvesting and deployment of massive amounts of data by algorithms whose operations are opaque to everyday understanding.
