Responsible Data Science,DATA7002,"Gathering, understanding, interpreting and making decisions based on collected data is an invaluable tool for science, business and governments. Concerns about privacy, consent, confidentiality, discrimination, ownership, commercialisation, intellectual property and the importance of fair benefit sharing are known. Being aware of conflicts of interest and the need to ensure equity, reciprocity and respect for cultural diversity are increasingly seen as important. What is less recognised is the nature of the roles of those who access and make decisions about collected linked personal information. The emerging global banked data that has become a key part of contemporary decision-making raises questions about the role of the data scientist. In this course students will critically analyse the ethical and legal foundations of data science governance that are relevant to the technical processes of data collection, storage, exchange and access. Issues covered will include the ethical dimensions of data management, legal and regulatory frameworks in Australia and in relevant jurisdictions, data policy, data privacy, data ownership, legal liabilities regarding analytical decisions, and discrimination. The course will equip students to identify the ethical and legislative requirements that underpin the technical processes of data science and to apply ethical and legal considerations to the core processes of data analytics. It will also introduce algorithms and technical approaches to minimise the risk of data identifiability and disclosure. A range of case studies will be used to explore these issues in applications of data science, including the use of government administrative data for informing social policy, to integrate ethical, legal and technical considerations.","Identify the key ethical, legal and technical considerations that are intrinsic to integrity in data science practice.| Gain practical skills in predicting, identifying, assessing, evaluating and responding to the ethical conflicts and dilemmas that are likely to occur within data science.     | Explain the different legal and ethics approaches that underpin the application of data science| Apply relevant Australian and international law and ethics theory to contemporary data science problems| Evaluate the effectiveness of different legal and ethics approaches relevant to the application of data science| Ability to identify relevant ethics and legal aspects of data science and apply appropriate techniques and algorithms for data de-identification to ensure privacy and non-disclosure when required.","NA",Master of Data Science,MDataSc
