This subject is designed to provide students with the ability to combine estimated measures of evidence, known as effects, from comparable studies to increase power. Estimators are introduced which are commonly found in meta-analytic research and pitfalls are discussed. On completion of the subject, the student will have an understanding of the different effects that can be collected from the literature as well as an appreciation of how effect sizes arising from data measured on different scales can be combined. Importantly, this subject also shows students how meta-regression can be used to account for study-specific covariates that cannot be adequately accounted for using random-effects models. The freely available software packages R and RevMan are used throughout the subject.","Prerequisites: Must be admitted in the Master of Data Science (SMDS) and have passed STM4PSD or both STA4SS and STM4PM Other students require Coordinators Approval ","1.Present clear, well-structured arguments that validate the combination of effect sizes from several studies that may differ in several aspects, including with respect to moderators and data measurement scales 2.Describe summary output from meta-analyses in a manner which can be understood by scientists with weak statistical backgrounds, but with knowledge from the discipline for which the research question is of interest 3.Demonstrate an expert understanding of the use of statistical software packages by carrying out valid analyses of real meta-data and providing clear interpretations of all computer output 4.Critique and summarise published meta-analyses, clearly highlighting weaknesses and flaws that undermine the key findings","Specialisation",NA,NA,NA
