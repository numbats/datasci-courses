Game Theory is a revolutionary way of analysing strategic interactive situations. It is basic to the understanding of market competition among large firms, the designing of incentive contracts, bidding at auctions, bargaining, and other similar problems central to economics and business. This course covers simultaneous and sequential games and their solution concepts, games of imperfect information, repeated games, and a selection of applications and case studies.","ZZBU5611 - Strategic Decision Making","Pre-requisite: ECON5103","core"
