The aim of this project is to characterise what the so-called "data science" degrees are by collecting data on units associated with data science degrees. In particular, what are the core competencies of students graduating these data science degrees?

The data collection will focus (at least initially) on Australian universities and collect data on unit descriptions, learning objectives and how much of the teaching component appear to be on statistics, mathematics, computer science or other disciplines.
